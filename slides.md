# Unifying Travels & Viagens
**Architecture & Roadmap**

layout: section

# Summary

---

## Problem & Vision
**Problem**  
- Two customer-facing apps (Travels: Struts/JSP on Tomcat; Viagens: React SPA + BFF)  
- Multiple backends across AWS, GCP, Azure  
- Low test coverage, batch releases, coordination overhead

**Vision**  
- A **single, resilient, fast web experience** powered by a **frontend platform** (React/Next.js shell) that composes **domain micro-frontends** and brokers requests via **domain BFFs** across existing backends.

---

## Approach & Outcomes

**Approach (high level)**  
- **Micro-frontends (MFE) with a shell** + **domain BFFs** + **API gateway**  
- **Feature flags**, **contract testing**, **progressive delivery**  
- **Strangler Fig** to retire Struts/JSP gradually

**Outcomes**  
- **Faster delivery:** Independent team deployments, reduced coordination overhead
- **Better user experience:** Unified interface, improved Core Web Vitals, faster page loads
- **Reduced risk:** Progressive rollouts, feature flags, immediate rollback capability
- **Operational efficiency:** Consolidated data aggregation, simplified maintenance
- **Future flexibility:** Backend-agnostic design enables gradual modernization

[Unified Web Platform Architecture]
[Users] â”€â”€> [CDN/Edge + WAF] â”€â”€> [Unified Web App Shell (Next.js SSR/ISR)]
                                    â”‚
                                    â”œâ”€> [MFE: Search & Discovery]
                                    â”œâ”€> [MFE: Booking]
                                    â”œâ”€> [MFE: Registration]
                                    â””â”€> [MFE: Account/Payments/...]
                                    
MFE â”€â”€> Domain BFF â”€â”€> API Gateway â”€â”€> { Travels Backend (AWS) }
                   â””â”€â”€> API Gateway â”€â”€> { Viagens Backend (GCP) }
                                    â””â”€â”€> { Azure services | 3rd parties }
```

**Why this approach?**  
- Keeps heterogeneous backends intact; **no backend unification required**  
- **Domain BFFs as aggregation layer**: consolidate data from 2 companies (eg.merge destination lists)
- **Response orchestration**: BFFs handle complex scenarios (merging search results, normalizing data)
- SSR/ISR via **Next.js** â†’ better **SEO/Core Web Vitals** vs SPA-only  
- **API Gateway**: routing, rate limiting, authz, cross-cloud abstraction

---

## Key Technology Choices
<br />

- **Web shell:** React + Next.js (SSR/ISR) with **Module Federation** for MFEs
- **BFFs (Backend for Frontend):**
  - Node/TypeScript for response aggregation and data transformation
  - **Key responsibilities:** Merge data from Travels + Viagens, normalize formats, handle pagination
  - Example: Search BFF calls both backends, merges destinations, deduplicates, sorts by relevance
- **Contracts:** REST/JSON or GraphQL; **consumer-driven contracts** (Pact) MFEâ†”BFF & BFFâ†”Backend
- **Edge/CDN:** Cloudflare/Akamai/Fastly for assets, image optimization

# Migration Roadmap

---

## Migration Strategy Overview

**Approach:** Big bang migration with comprehensive preparation and revenue protection

**Key Phases:** Discovery â†’ Foundations â†’ Preparation â†’ Migration â†’ Optimization

**Revenue Protection:** Pre-migration testing, performance benchmarking, immediate rollback capability

---

## Phase 0-2: Preparation & Build

**Phase 0 â€” Discovery & Planning**  
- Inventory frontends/backends, auth, analytics, SEO, SLAs  
- Baseline current metrics (conversion, performance, revenue)

**Phase 1 â€” Foundations**  
- Stand up **Web Shell + first MFE skeleton**  
- Platform toolchain (CI/CD, flags, telemetry, design system)  
- Create **API Gateway** + **Booking BFF** (pilot)

**Phase 2 â€” Complete Migration Preparation**  
- Build **all MFEs** (Search, Booking, Registration, Payments, Account)  
- **Feature parity validation**: comprehensive testing vs legacy functionality  
- Performance benchmarking to ensure **â‰¥100% baseline performance**

---

## Phase 3-4: Migration & Optimization

**Phase 3 â€” Big Bang Migration**  
- **Complete cutover** from legacy to new platform during maintenance window (minimal impact)
- **Immediate monitoring**: revenue, conversion, performance dashboards  
- **Fast rollback capability** if any KPIs drop below acceptable thresholds

**Phase 4 â€” Stabilization & Optimization**  
- Performance tuning and optimization post-migration  
- Legacy system decommission once stability confirmed  
- Platform improvements and feature development

**Critical Success Factors for Revenue Protection:** Comprehensive testing, performance benchmarking, immediate rollback capability, intensive monitoring

# Team Topology & Responsibilities

---

## Org Model
- **Frontend Platform (Enablement) Team**  
  Paved-road: shell, design system, CI/CD templates, linting, accessibility, i18n, perf budgets
- **Domain Product Squads** (Booking, Registration, Search, Account, etc.)  
  Own **MFE + Domain BFF**; end-to-end delivery (UX â†’ prod)
- **Platform/SRE**  
  Incident mgmt, capacity/cost, IaC, security baselines
- **QA as Engineering Discipline**  
  Embedded SDETs; contract testing, E2E in prod-like, accessibility, non-functional
- **Data/Analytics**  
  Event schema, consent, dashboards, experimentation framework

> **Ownership:** CODEOWNERS/Backstage catalog; runbooks; on-call per domain; error budgets

# Processes and Best Practices

---

## Engineering Excellence & Delivery
**Development Practices**
- **Trunk-based development** with short-lived feature branches
- **CI/CD per MFE/BFF** with automated quality gates
- **Consumer-driven contract testing** (Pact) between all boundaries
- **Test pyramid:** Unit (70%) â†’ Integration (20%) â†’ E2E (10%)
- **Ephemeral preview environments** per PR; visual regression + accessibility checks
- **Static analysis & coverage gates** enforced in CI pipeline

**Quality Assurance**
- **Shift-left testing:** PR previews, visual regression, accessibility
- **Performance budgets** enforced in CI (bundle size, Core Web Vitals)
- **Code quality gates:** Coverage >80%, no critical vulnerabilities

**Delivery & Operations**
- **Progressive delivery:** Feature flags, canary releases, A/B testing
- **Infrastructure as Code**; **GitOps** for environment promotion
- **Incident management:** Runbooks, on-call rotation, blameless postmortems

---

## Common Questions & Talking Points
<br />

- **Why micro-frontends vs one SPA?** Org alignment, independent deploys, safer migration
- **Why Next.js SSR/ISR?** Better SEO & Core Web Vitals; edge cacheability; partial static regen
- **Avoiding a distributed monolith?** Clear contracts, BFF boundaries, consumer tests, ownership, observability
- **Backend unification later?** Design is backend-agnostic; unify behind BFFs/gateway when timing is right
- **Keeping quality high?** Shift-left: unit/component/contract; few critical E2Es; PR previews; a11y checks
- **Release strategy?** Progressive delivery (flags/canary), error budgets, auto-rollback
- **Data privacy?** Consent mgmt; minimize PII; policy-as-code; auditing
