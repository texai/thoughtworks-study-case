# Summary

---

## Problem & Vision
**Problem**  
- Two customer-facing apps (Travels: Struts/JSP on Tomcat; Viagens: React SPA + BFF)  
- Multiple backends across AWS, GCP, Azure  
- Low test coverage, batch releases, coordination overhead

**Vision**  
- A **single, resilient, fast web experience** powered by a **frontend platform** (React/Next.js shell) that composes **domain micro-frontends** and brokers requests via **domain BFFs** across existing backends.

---

## Approach & Outcomes

<br />

### Approach (high level)

- **Micro-frontends (MFE) with a shell** + **domain BFFs** + **API Gateway**  
- **Feature flags**, **contract testing**, **progressive delivery**  
- **Strangler Fig** to retire Struts/JSP gradually

<br />

### Outcomes

- **Faster delivery:** Independent team deployments, reduced coordination overhead
- **Better user experience:** Unified interface, improved Core Web Vitals, faster page loads
- **Reduced risk:** Progressive rollouts, feature flags, immediate rollback capability
- **Operational efficiency:** Consolidated data aggregation, simplified maintenance
- **Future flexibility:** Backend-agnostic design enables gradual modernization

[Unified Web Platform Architecture]
[Users] â”€â”€> [CDN/Edge + WAF] â”€â”€> [Unified Web App Shell (Next.js SSR/ISR)]

                                    â”œâ”€> [MFE: Search & Discovery]
                                    â”œâ”€> [MFE: Booking]
                                    â”œâ”€> [MFE: Registration]
                                    â””â”€> [MFE: Account/Payments/...]
                                    
MFE â”€â”€> Domain BFF â”€â”€> API Gateway â”€â”€> { Travels Backend (AWS) }
                   â””â”€â”€> API Gateway â”€â”€> { Viagens Backend (GCP) }
                                    â””â”€â”€> { Azure services | 3rd parties }
```

### Why this approach?

- Keeps heterogeneous backends intact; **no backend unification required**  
- **Domain BFFs as aggregation layer**: consolidate data from 2 companies (e.g., merge destination lists)
- **Response orchestration**: BFFs handle complex scenarios (merging search results, normalizing data)
- SSR/ISR via **Next.js** â†’ better **SEO/Core Web Vitals** vs SPA-only  
- **API Gateway**: routing, rate limiting, authz, cross-cloud abstraction

---

## Key Technology Choices
<br />

- **Web shell:** React + Next.js (SSR/ISR) with **Module Federation** for MFEs
- **BFFs (Backend for Frontend):**
  - Node/TypeScript for response aggregation and data transformation
  - **Key responsibilities:** Merge data from Travels + Viagens, normalize formats, handle pagination
  - Example: Search BFF calls both backends, merges destinations, deduplicates, sorts by relevance
- **Contracts:** REST/JSON or GraphQL; **consumer-driven contracts** (Pact) MFEâ†”BFF & BFFâ†”Backend
- **Edge/CDN:** Cloudflare/Akamai/Fastly for assets, image optimization

# Migration Roadmap

---

## Migration Strategy Overview

**Approach:** Big bang migration with comprehensive preparation and revenue protection

**Key Phases:** Discovery â†’ Foundations â†’ Preparation â†’ Migration â†’ Optimization

**Revenue Protection:** Pre-migration testing, performance benchmarking, immediate rollback capability

---

## Phase 0-2: Preparation & Build

**Phase 0 â€” Discovery & Planning**  
- Inventory frontends/backends, auth, analytics, SEO, SLAs  
- Baseline current metrics (conversion, performance, revenue)

**Phase 1 â€” Foundations**  
- Stand up Web Shell + first MFE skeleton  
- Platform toolchain (CI/CD, flags, telemetry, design system)  
- Create API Gateway + Booking BFF (pilot)

**Phase 2 â€” Complete Migration Preparation**  
- Build all MFEs (Search, Booking, Registration, Account, Payments)  
- Feature parity validation: comprehensive testing vs legacy functionality  
- Performance benchmarking to ensure â‰¥100% baseline performance

---

## Phase 3-4: Migration & Optimization

**Phase 3 â€” Big Bang Migration**  
- Complete cutover from legacy to new platform during maintenance window (minimal impact)
- Immediate monitoring: revenue, conversion, performance dashboards  
- Fast rollback capability if any KPIs drop below acceptable thresholds

**Phase 4 â€” Stabilization & Optimization**  
- Performance tuning and optimization post-migration  
- Legacy system decommission once stability confirmed  
- Platform improvements and feature development

**Critical Success Factors for Revenue Protection:** Comprehensive testing, performance benchmarking, immediate rollback capability, intensive monitoring

# Additional Reference Materials
_For Q&A and deeper discussion_

---

## Observability & Monitoring

**Distributed Tracing & APM**
- **OpenTelemetry** â†’ centralized APM/logs across all MFEs and BFFs
- **Performance monitoring** for Core Web Vitals and API response times

**SLOs**
- **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)** for availability, latency, and error rates
- **Automated alerting** based on SLO violations

**Dashboards & Insights**
- **Real-time dashboards** for business metrics (conversion, revenue)
- **Technical dashboards** for system health and performance

---

## Security & Compliance

**Security Architecture**
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall)** at CDN/Edge layer for DDoS and attack protection
- **CSP (Content Security Policy)** and Trusted Types to prevent XSS attacks
- **Secrets management** with centralized vault and rotation policies

**Security Engineering**
- **SAST/DAST** (Static/Dynamic Application Security Testing) in CI/CD pipeline
- **Dependency scanning** for vulnerable packages and libraries

---

## Common Questions & Talking Points
<br />

- **Why micro-frontends vs one SPA?** Org alignment, independent deploys, safer migration
- **Why Next.js SSR/ISR?** Better SEO & Core Web Vitals; edge cacheability; partial static regen
- **Avoiding a distributed monolith?** Clear contracts, BFF boundaries, consumer tests, ownership, observability
- **Backend unification later?** Design is backend-agnostic; unify behind BFFs/gateway when timing is right
- **Keeping quality high?** Shift-left: unit/component/contract; few critical E2Es; PR previews; a11y checks
- **Release strategy?** Progressive delivery (flags/canary), error budgets, auto-rollback
- **Data privacy?** Consent mgmt; minimize PII; policy-as-code; auditing
